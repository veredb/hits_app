This is a Ruby on Rails project, that is supported by a mysql database.


In this app, a csv file - lib/tasks/import_batting.rake, is imported to the database by a rake task.

The csv file includes batting results in a baseball game.

A search action was added to the controller, which queries the database for the most improved batting average( hits / at-bats) 

from 2009 to 2010. Â Only including players with at least 200 at-bats.
